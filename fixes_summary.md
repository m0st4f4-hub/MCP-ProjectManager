# Task Manager Project Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Backend Circular Import Issues:**
   - Fixed circular imports between `task_dependencies.py` and `task_dependency_validation.py`
   - Fixed circular imports between `project_file_associations.py` and `project_file_association_validation.py`
   - Created utility modules to break circular dependencies
   - Implemented more modular structure with files under 230 LOC

2. **Frontend React Component Issues:**
   - Added "use client" directive to components using React hooks:
     - ProjectDetail.tsx
     - ProjectMembers.tsx
     - ProjectFiles.tsx

## Current Status

1. **Backend:**
   - Circular imports have been fixed
   - The backend still has import path issues when running with `uvicorn`
   - May need to modify PYTHONPATH or fix import paths

2. **Frontend:**
   - Fixed "use client" directive issues in React components
   - API URL is configured to use `http://localhost:8080` with fallback
   - Need to ensure the backend is properly running at that URL

## Plan to Complete Fixes

1. **Backend:**
   - Create a proper Python package structure with setup.py
   - Fix the import paths in the main.py file
   - Ensure the backend server starts correctly on port 8080
   - Run tests to verify functionality

2. **Frontend:**
   - Fix any remaining "use client" directive issues
   - Ensure proper connection to backend API
   - Test UI functionality

3. **Integration:**
   - Verify frontend can make successful API calls to backend
   - Test core workflows (project management, task creation, etc.)
