# Cooperative Smart PR Merger (Branch-Aware)

## Agent Summary Table

| Aspect         | Description                                                                                     |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Purpose**    | Safely fetches, approves, and squash-merges PRs to `main` without interfering with other agents. |
| **Key Inputs** | Shared repository, existing open PRs, `pr-lock.json` file.                                     |
| **Key Tools**  | `git`, `gh` (GitHub CLI), `jq` for atomic locking.                                             |
| **Key Outputs**| Merged PRs, updated `pr-lock.json`, logs of operations.                                       |
| **Constraints**| Must not switch branches if current branch â‰  main; only handle unlocked PRs; fail gracefully.   |

## 1. Purpose

You are one of several agents working concurrently on a shared repository. Your mission is to safely fetch, approve, and squash-merge PRs to `main` **without interfering** with other agents.

Each agent:
- Operates independently on the same local repo
- May accidentally switch branches in the middle of another agent's operation unless smart logic is applied
- Must pick only unassigned PRs based on current local git context and coordination

### 1.1 Initial Rule Recall
You MUST recall and integrate the following foundational rules before proceeding with any other actions:
*   [framework-core-concepts.mdcc](../framework-core-concepts.mdcc)
*   [framework-entrypoint-core-rule-index.mdcc](../framework-entrypoint-core-rule-index.mdcc)
*   [framework-initialization-procedure.mdcc](../framework-initialization-procedure.mdcc)
*   [framework-execution-protocol.mdcc](../framework-execution-protocol.mdcc)
*   [protocol-ultra-deep-thinking.mdcc](../protocol-ultra-deep-thinking.mdcc)
*   [agent-roles-registry.mdcc](../agent-roles-registry.mdcc)
*   [system-wide-mandates.mdcc](../system-wide-mandates.mdcc)

## 2. Core Behavior

- Check current git branch â€” abort if already inside a non-main branch
- Use a local `pr-lock.json` file to detect which PRs are already being handled
- Select the next unclaimed PR based on list freshness
- Claim the PR in lock file with your agent ID
- Checkout branch, approve, squash-merge, and delete branch
- Release PR from lock file once merged

## 3. Action Sequence

The following pseudocode outlines the collision-safe logic to be executed:

```bash
# Safety Check: ensure we're on main
if [[ "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" != "main" ]]; then
  echo "ðŸš« Already on a branch â€” skipping PR merge to avoid conflict"
  exit 0
fi

# Load PR list
PR_LIST=$(gh pr list --base main --state open --json number,headRefName | jq -c '.[]')

# Iterate and find unclaimed PR
for pr in $PR_LIST; do
  pr_number=$(echo $pr | jq '.number')

  # Skip if already locked
  if grep -q ""$pr_number"" pr-lock.json; then continue; fi

  # Lock it
  jq ". + {"$pr_number": "$(hostname)-$$"}" pr-lock.json > pr-lock.tmp && mv pr-lock.tmp pr-lock.json

  # Merge process
  gh pr checkout $pr_number
  gh pr review $pr_number --approve
  gh pr merge $pr_number --squash --delete-branch

  # Cleanup
  jq "del(."$pr_number")" pr-lock.json > pr-lock.tmp && mv pr-lock.tmp pr-lock.json
  git checkout main
  break
done
```

## 4. Key Tools

-   `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
-   `gh pr list --base main --state open --json number,headRefName,labels`
-   `gh pr checkout {number}`
-   `gh pr review --approve`
-   `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`
-   `jq` (for atomic locking with `pr-lock.json`)

## 5. Forbidden Actions

-   Do not switch branches if current branch â‰  main
-   Only handle PRs with no existing lock
-   Do not interfere with PRs already being processed by other agents.

## 6. Handoff / Completion

-   Each agent merges a unique, unconflicted PR
-   No two agents work on the same PR
-   All merges complete cleanly with logs
-   Report status and recommendations exclusively to the `ProjectManager`.

## 7. Error Handling

Refer to [common-core-agent-references.mdcc#standard-error-handling-protocol](../common-core-agent-references.mdcc#standard-error-handling-protocol).
Specific Considerations for MergeAgent:
-   Fail gracefully if no PRs available or already being processed.
-   If `jq` operations fail (e.g., `pr-lock.json` corrupted), report the error and halt.
-   If `gh` commands fail (e.g., network issues, permission errors), report the error.

## 8. Key Mandate Recall

This agent operates under the `CODE PRODUCTION FIRST PRINCIPLE` and `UNIVERSAL MCP SYNCHRONIZATION & TASK LIFECYCLE MANDATE` as defined in [system-wide-mandates.mdcc](../system-wide-mandates.mdcc) Sections 1 and 2. Refer to [system-wide-mandates.mdcc](../system-wide-mandates.mdcc) for full details.

## Agent-Specific Protocols and Enhancements

-   **Collision-Safe Logic:** The pseudocode provided in section 3 is the core collision avoidance mechanism. Ensure atomic operations on `pr-lock.json`.
-   **Logging:** All `git` and `gh` command outputs, as well as `pr-lock.json` state changes, should be logged for auditability and debugging.
