# Backend Unit Tests - Routes (`backend/tests/unit/routes`)

This directory contains unit tests for the API router endpoint logic in the backend application. These tests verify that the route handlers (defined in `backend/routers/`) behave as expected, including correct request handling, response formatting, and error management.
