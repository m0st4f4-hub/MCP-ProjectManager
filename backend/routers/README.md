# API Routers (`backend/routers`)

This directory contains the FastAPI routers that define the **46 API endpoints** for the MCP Project Manager Suite backend. The endpoints are organized into modular files within subdirectories for better organization, maintainability, and feature consistency.

## ðŸŽ¯ Router Architecture

### Core Entity Management

**`projects/`** - **Project Management**
- `core.py`: **Project CRUD** with filtering (status, priority, visibility, search, archived state, owner)
- `files.py`: Project-file associations with validation
- `members.py`: Role-based member management with permissions
- `planning.py`: Project planning and workflow features

**`tasks/`** - **Task Management**
- `core/core.py`: **Task operations** with filtering (agent, status, search, archived, sorting)
- `dependencies/dependencies.py`: Task dependency management with relationship types
- Task workflow with 18 distinct statuses

**`users/`** - **User Management**
- `core/core.py`: **Role-based user operations** with filtering (role, active status, search across multiple fields)
- `auth/`: Authentication and token generation with role validation

**`agents/`** - **Agent Management**  
- `core.py`: **Agent operations** with status filtering, archive/unarchive, and capability tracking

### New Features

**`enums.py`** - **Enum Value Endpoints**
- `/project-status` - Available project statuses (`active`, `completed`, `paused`, `archived`, `cancelled`)
- `/project-priority` - Available project priorities (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`)  
- `/project-visibility` - Available visibility levels (`private`, `team`, `public`)
- `/project-member-role` - Available member roles
- `/task-status` - Available task statuses (18 workflow states)

**Response Models**
- All endpoints use `DataResponse[T]` for single items
- All listing endpoints use `ListResponse[T]` with pagination info
- Error handling and status codes

### Specialized Services

**`memory/`** - **Knowledge Graph & Storage**
- `core/`: Core memory entity operations with relationship mapping

- `relations/`: Memory relation endpoints with graph traversal

**`mcp/`** - **MCP Tool Integration**
- Core MCP tools and agent automation endpoints
- Metrics and monitoring capabilities with usage tracking
- Stream event subscription for real-time updates

**`audit_logs/`** - **Audit Management**
- Change tracking across all entities
- Archive/restore operation logging
- User action monitoring with detailed context

**`comments/`** - **Comment Management**
- Threaded comment system for projects and tasks
- User attribution and timestamp tracking

**`project_templates/`** - **Template Management**
- Project template CRUD operations
- Template-based project creation workflow

**`rules/`** - **Rules Framework**
- `logs/`: Agent behavior logs and tracking
- `mandates/`: Universal mandates and compliance
- `roles/`: Agent roles with capabilities
- `roles/capabilities/`: Agent capability management
- `roles/forbidden_actions/`: Action restriction management
- `templates/`: Prompt templates and automation
- `utils/`: Rule validation and prompt generation utilities
- `violations/`: Rule violation tracking and reporting
- `workflows/`: Workflow automation and management

## ðŸš€ API Summary

### âœ… Filtering Capabilities
- **Projects**: Filter by status, priority, visibility, owner, archived state + search by name/description
- **Tasks**: Filter by agent, status, search terms, archived state with sorting
- **Users**: Filter by role, active status + search across username/email/full_name  
- **Agents**: Filter by status, capabilities, archived state + search

### âœ… Archive Management
Soft deletion with restore capabilities across all major entities:
- Projects: `POST /{id}/archive` & `POST /{id}/unarchive`
- Tasks: `POST /{task_number}/archive` & `POST /{task_number}/unarchive`
- Agents: `POST /{id}/archive` & `POST /{id}/unarchive`

### âœ… Unified Enum System
- Centralized enum definitions in `/backend/enums.py`
- Frontend-accessible via `/api/v1/enums/` endpoints
- Validation across all entity operations

### âœ… Pagination
- Total count support for UI rendering
- Pagination parameters across all listing endpoints
- `has_more` flags for infinite scroll implementations
