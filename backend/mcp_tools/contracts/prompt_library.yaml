notes: |
  The Prompt Library Tool provides a centralized way to manage reusable prompts for agent workflows.
  Prompts can include template variables that are substituted at runtime, making them highly flexible
  for different contexts. The tool supports categorization, tagging, and search functionality to help
  agents quickly find the right prompts for their tasks.
