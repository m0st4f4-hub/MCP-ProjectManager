This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Inception Project: Refactoring Status

This section tracks the progress of the "Inception Project," a comprehensive refactoring initiative aimed at improving modularity and maintainability of the frontend codebase.

### Overall Status: Partially Complete

While significant progress has been made, particularly with the `TaskItem` component, several other key components still require refactoring to meet the project's modularity goals (typically aiming for components under ~240 lines of code).

### Key Component Status:

*   **`TaskItem` (and sub-components in `src/components/task/`):**
    *   **Status:** Refactoring Complete.
    *   **Notes:** Successfully modularized, types/styles/utils extracted, and documented in `src/components/task/README.md`. Static analysis (lint, type-check, build) PASSES.
*   **`ProjectList.tsx` (`src/components/ProjectList.tsx`):**
    *   **Status:** Refactoring Incomplete.
    *   **Notes:** Currently 1107 lines. Still requires significant modularization. (Original Target: Dream Level 2)
*   **`Dashboard.tsx` (`src/components/Dashboard.tsx`):**
    *   **Status:** Refactoring Incomplete.
    *   **Notes:** Currently 587 lines. Still requires significant modularization. (Original Target: Dream Level 4)
*   **`TaskList.tsx` (`src/components/TaskList.tsx`):**
    *   **Status:** Refactoring Incomplete.
    *   **Notes:** Currently 296 lines. Still requires modularization. (Original Target: Dream Level 3)
*   **`TaskControls.tsx` (`src/components/TaskControls.tsx`):**
    *   **Status:** Refactoring Incomplete.
    *   **Notes:** Currently 337 lines. Still requires modularization. (Original Target: Dream Level 7)
*   **`MCPDevTools.tsx` (`src/components/MCPDevTools.tsx`):**
    *   **Status:** Refactoring Incomplete.
    *   **Notes:** Currently 452 lines. Still requires modularization. (Original Target: Dream Level 6)
*   Other components like `AgentList.tsx` and `SettingsContent.tsx` also remain relatively large and could be candidates for future refactoring.

### Verification Status:

*   **Static Analysis (Lint, Type Check, Build):** PASSING (after recent fixes).
*   **Automated Tests:** Currently, no "test" script is configured in `package.json` for the frontend. Adding comprehensive unit and integration tests is highly recommended.
*   **Browser-Based Audits (Accessibility, Performance, etc.):** Currently unavailable due to issues with the browser connector server. Restoring this capability is important for ongoing UI quality assurance.

### Recommendations:

1.  **Prioritize completion of refactoring for `ProjectList.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, `TaskList.tsx`, `TaskControls.tsx`, and `MCPDevTools.tsx`.**
2.  **Implement a robust testing suite** for the frontend, including unit and integration tests.
3.  **Resolve browser connector issues** to enable comprehensive UI audits.
4.  Consider refactoring other larger components like `AgentList.tsx` and `SettingsContent.tsx`.
