# Task Manager Project - Fix Recommendations

## Current Status

1. **Backend:**
   - Fixed circular import issues between files
   - Improved code modularity (files under 230 LOC)
   - Issue with Python dependencies/environment preventing server startup

2. **Frontend:**
   - Fixed "use client" directive in React components
   - Modified components to use proper Next.js patterns
   - Unable to start the frontend server for testing

## Recommended Fixes

### Backend

1. **Fix Python Environment:**
   - Consider creating a fresh virtual environment:
     ```
     python -m venv .venv-new
     .\.venv-new\Scripts\activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Fix Import Structure:**
   - Create a proper package structure using `__init__.py` files
   - Use relative imports consistently within the package
   - Consider a simpler main.py file with fewer imports

3. **Manual Testing:**
   - Test each component individually to isolate issues
   - Add more logging to trace error sources
   - Implement better error handling

### Frontend

1. **Fix "use client" directives:**
   - Check all components using React hooks and add the directive
   - Ensure parent components of client components also have the directive

2. **API Configuration:**
   - Ensure the frontend is looking for the backend on the correct port
   - Use environment variables for API endpoints
   - Implement robust error handling for API failures

### Integration

1. **Simplified Testing Approach:**
   - Start with minimal components to test connectivity
   - Test one endpoint at a time
   - Add features incrementally once the basic system works

## Next Steps

1. Focus on getting a minimal version of both backend and frontend running
2. Verify connectivity between the systems
3. Incrementally add features and test
4. Continue the refactoring process in small, verifiable steps

The issues appear to be related to the Python environment and module import structure. Consider a fresh start with a simplified architecture to verify the basic functionality before implementing the full system.
